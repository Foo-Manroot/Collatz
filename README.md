# Collatz
  This repository was created as a response to a internship offer, where we were told to create a simple program to calculate the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

  As I saw that this repository was no longer needed, I decide to use it to train my knowledge on different languages, and learn new ones. Every folder is dedicated to each one implementation on a given language. In these folders there should be another README to explain how to run the program, if needed (even without any instructions, it should be pretty straight-forward).

  Also, this repository can be used to back my claims of knowledge (at least on a basic level) on a given language.

## Languages
  These are the currently available iumplementations, each one in their corresponding folder:
  - C (this was the original, the one used for the internship offer)
  - Scala
  - Bash
  - Lisp
  - Prolog
  - Python
  - PHP
  - Java
  - LOLCODE
  - Ruby
